GD::Thumbnail
=============

This a thumbnail maker. Thumbnails are smaller versions of the
original image/graphic/picture and are used for preview purposes,
where bigger images can take a long time to load. They are also 
used in image galleries to preview a lot of images at a time.

This module also has the capability to add information strips
about the original image. Original image's size (in bytes)
and resolution & mime type can be added to the thumbnail's
upper and lower parts. This feature can be useful for web
software (image galleries or forums).

This is a Yet Another type of module. There are several 
other thumbnail modules on CPAN, but they simply don't have 
the features I need, so this module is written to increase
the thumbnail population on CPAN.

Read the module's POD for documentation, examples and other 
information.
